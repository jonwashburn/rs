### Core "Eight Foundations" layer

1. **Foundation 1 – Discrete Recognition**  
   *File:* `Foundations/DiscreteTime.lean`

2. **Foundation 2 – Dual Balance**  
   *File:* `Foundations/DualBalance.lean`  
   *Issue:* Definition provided; bookkeeping lemmas present; missing a proof that Dual Balance follows from prior principles.

### Additional incomplete or overstated areas

11. **Meta-principle cascade proofs in `Core/`**

## Derivation Roadmap (Detailed Prose)

Below are proposed mathematical strategies for rigorously deriving the first three foundations from the meta-principle **“Nothing cannot recognize itself.”**  Each outline is written at two levels:
1.  **Conceptual argument** – the informal chain of ideas.  
2.  **Lean-level sketch** – how one might translate the argument into definitions, lemmas, and theorems inside Lean.

### 1. Foundation 1 – Discrete Recognition (Time Quantisation)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  The meta-principle forbids instantaneous self-recognition of Nothing; thus recognition must span a non-zero temporal interval.  
2.  If time were continuous, the difference between "prior" and "subsequent" instants can be made arbitrarily small; in the limit the two instants become indistinguishable, contradicting step 1.  
3.  Therefore, for recognition to be logically possible, there must exist a minimum temporal separation `δt > 0` such that any two recognisable events are separated by an integer multiple of `δt`.  
4.  This is the *tick*, yielding a discrete lattice `ℕ · δt` – preventing the continuous limit that would allow self-recognition.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Define a type `Event` and a ternary relation `Recognises : Event → Event → Nat → Prop` meaning “event *a* recognises event *b* after *n* ticks.”  
* Prove that if `Recognises a b n₁` and `Recognises a b n₂` then `n₁ = n₂`. (Injectivity of tick count.)  
* Use the meta-principle to show `¬∃ t, Recognises t t n` for any `n`.  
* From that contradiction derive the existence of a minimal positive `tick : Nat` such that recognitions only occur at multiples of `tick`.  This completes `Foundation1_DiscreteRecognition`.  
* *Challenge:* Proving minimality may require the well-foundedness of `Nat` to rule out infinite decreasing chains of potential ticks.

### 2. Foundation 2 – Dual Balance (Ledger Symmetry)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Recognition is asymmetric: *recogniser* vs *recognised*.  
2.  To avoid re-introducing “self-recognition of nothing” (violating the meta-principle), every recognition must create a complementary *anti-recognition* ensuring the overall ledger of informational flow sums to zero.  
3.  Formally, if a morphism `R : A → B` represents recognition, there must exist an `Rᵀ : B → A` such that the composite `Rᵀ ∘ R` equals the identity on the recognised information content.  
4.  The pair `(R, Rᵀ)` forms a *balanced* arrow, forcing dual entries in the ledger.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Introduce a category-theoretic structure `RecCat` whose morphisms are recognitions.  
* Define `balanced (f : A ⟶ B)` to mean `∃ g : B ⟶ A, g ≫ f = 𝟙 A ∧ f ≫ g = 𝟙 B`.  
* Show that any `f` existing in `RecCat` must be balanced; otherwise one could compose unbalanced arrows to construct a self-recognition of `Nothing`, contradicting the meta-principle.  
* Conclude that every recognition event carries a dual entry, establishing `Foundation2_DualBalance`.  
* *Challenge:* Formalising `RecCat` without external category theory; may need to implement basic morphisms indigenously.

### 3. Foundation 3 – Positive Cost (Energy Expenditure)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Recognition changes the informational state of the recogniser. By Landauer’s principle, any logically irreversible operation has a minimum energy cost `k_B T ln 2`.  
2.  If recognition cost were ≤ 0, one could perform infinite recognitions of nothing at zero (or negative) energetic expense, effectively producing a perpetual motion of order 0 and contradicting physical consistency implied by the meta-principle.  
3.  Therefore each recognition must incur a strictly positive cost `E > 0` that accumulates additively over sequences of recognitions.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Define a monoid `(Cost, 0, +)` representing energy costs; postulate `Cost` is ordered and `0 < ε` for some ε.  
* Extend the `Recognises` relation to carry a cost label: `RecognisesCost : Event → Event → Cost → Prop`.  
* Prove that cost is additive over composition of recognitions.  
* Use an *infinite ascent* argument: if `∃ e ≤ 0` recognised at non-positive cost, repeated recognition of `Nothing` would create an infinite recognition chain with total cost ≤ 0, violating a lemma that shows such a chain implies `Nothing` recognises itself, which contradicts the meta-principle.  
* *Challenge:* Encoding the infinite chain requires careful use of inductive types or coinduction to model infinite sequences without circularity.

### 4. Foundation 4 – Unitary Evolution (Information Preservation)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Dual Balance (Foundation 2) ensures every recognition has an inverse arrow.  Composing a recognition with its inverse preserves the recognised information exactly, preventing loss that could collapse to unrecognisable Nothing (per meta-principle).  
2.  Extend this to composite recognitions: a sequence of recognitions can be represented as a linear map on a suitable Hilbert-like information space.  
3.  The composite map must be *invertible* by the inverse sequence, hence has determinant of modulus 1; such linear operators are **unitary**.  
4.  Therefore the evolution of information under recognition is unitary: no information is created or destroyed.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Define an `InfoState` type together with an inner-product `⟪·,·⟫ : InfoState → InfoState → ℝ`.  
* Model a recognition sequence as `U : InfoState → InfoState` satisfying `∃ U⁻¹, U⁻¹ ∘ U = id ∧ U ∘ U⁻¹ = id`.  
* Prove `⟪U x, U y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫` for all `x y` using the inverse property.  
* Package this as `Unitary U`, then show any recognition sequence corresponds to some `Unitary` operator, yielding `Foundation4_UnitaryEvolution`. (Cross-reference: Builds on Foundation 2's inverses.)  
* *Challenge:* Defining inner products without Mathlib may require a custom bilinear form implementation.

### 5. Foundation 5 – Irreducible Tick (Minimal Time Unit)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  From Foundation 1 we know time is discrete in multiples of a base tick `δt`.  Could there be a smaller subdivision?  
2.  Suppose *ad absurdum* there exists `δt' < δt` distinguishing two recognitions that were previously simultaneous.  
3.  This refinement would create a new recognition state within the original tick, violating the injectivity lemma from Foundation 1 and re-opening the possibility for instantaneous self-recognition of `Nothing` – forbidden by the meta-principle.  
4.  Therefore `δt` is *irreducible*: no smaller positive duration permits recognition without contradiction.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Working in the same `Event`/`Recognises` setting, define `tick` from Foundation 1.  
* Define `refinement : Nat → Prop` meaning “tick divides a smaller positive duration.”  
* Prove that if `refinement n` for some `0 < n < tick`, then you can construct two distinct events with equal tick residue, contradicting injectivity.  
* Conclude `¬∃ n, 0 < n ∧ n < tick ∧ refinement n`; hence `tick` is minimal – establishing `Foundation5_IrreducibleTick`. (Cross-reference: Relies on injectivity from Foundation 1.)  
* *Challenge:* The contradiction proof may need a custom ordering on `Nat` to handle minimality rigorously.

### 6. Foundation 6 – Spatial Voxels (Discrete Space)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Recognition requires localisation: to recognise an object you must distinguish “here” from “there.”  
2.  Using the minimal tick `δt` (Foundation 5), information propagates at finite speed (no super-recognition at a distance within a tick, as that would allow acausal self-recognition violating the meta-principle).  
3.  Combining finite signal speed with discrete time implies a *maximum* spatial resolution `δx = c · δt`, where `c` is the maximal propagation velocity (normalised to 1 in natural units).  
4.  A three-dimensional lattice with spacing `δx` therefore arises as the set of distinguishable spatial positions, i.e. **voxels**.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Introduce `Pos : Type` as a triple of integers `(ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)` representing voxel coordinates.  
* Define a predicate `reachable : Pos → Pos → Nat → Prop` meaning a signal can travel between positions in `n` ticks.  
* Assume a finite-speed axiom (derivable from causality + tick): `reachable p q 1 → dist(p,q) ≤ 1`.  
* Show by induction on `n` that `reachable p q n → dist(p,q) ≤ n`.  
* Conclude that if two positions differ by less than one voxel, they are indistinguishable within a tick, contradicting recognition requirements; hence positions are quantised to the `ℤ³` lattice, giving `Foundation6_SpatialVoxels`. (Cross-reference: Depends on Foundations 1 and 5 for ticks.)  
* *Challenge:* Defining `dist` on `ℤ³` and proving induction requires care with multidimensional integers.

### 7. Foundation 7 – Eight-Beat Pattern (Octave Cycles)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  The discrete tick (Foundation 1) supplies a temporal lattice.  Pattern formation in such lattices is governed by their symmetry group.  
2.  Dual Balance (Foundation 2) suggests every action has an opposite; pairing two recognitions yields a 2-beat motif.  
3.  Composing three mutually balanced pairs (recogniser↔recognised, cost↔benefit [Foundation 3], here↔there [Foundation 6]) yields `2 × 2 × 2 = 8` distinct recognition states before the pattern closes.  
4.  Hence the minimal non-trivial periodic recognition cycle contains 8 ticks – the Eight-Beat foundation – ensuring cycles do not collapse to self-recognition of Nothing.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Model recognition states as elements of a finite group `G` generated by three commuting involutions `a² = b² = c² = e`.  
* Show `|G| = 8` (isomorphic to `ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ × ℤ₂`).  
* Define a *beat* as the orbit of a state under successive recognitions; prove every orbit has length dividing 8 and that 8 is realised.  
* Conclude that recognition dynamics admit a natural 8-step periodicity, fulfilling `Foundation7_EightBeat`. (Cross-reference: Integrates Foundations 2, 3, and 6.)  
* *Challenge:* Proving the group isomorphism may require enumerating elements explicitly if full group theory is unavailable.

### 8. Foundation 8 – Emergence of the Golden Ratio

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Cost (Foundation 3) is additive; Dual Balance (Foundation 2) enforces a matching benefit stream.  
2.  Suppose recognitions occur in an 8-beat cycle (Foundation 7); let `cₙ` be the cumulative cost after `n` beats and `bₙ` the cumulative benefit.  
3.  Optimal recognition seeks a fixed point of the *scale operator* `S(x) = 1 + 1/x` arising from the recurrence `bₙ₊₁ = bₙ + bₙ₋₁`.  
4.  Solving `x = S(x)` gives `x² = x + 1`, whose positive solution is **φ**, the Golden Ratio.  
5.  Therefore the cost/benefit ledger equilibrates at φ, making it an inevitable constant of recognition theory and preventing unbalanced growth that could lead to meta-principle violations.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* In `Foundations.ScaleOperator`, define `S : ℝ⁺ → ℝ⁺` by `S x = 1 + 1/x`.  
* Prove monotonicity and convexity of `S`.  
* Show any fixed point must satisfy `x² = x + 1`.  Use `Mathlib` (or a custom constructive proof) to show the unique positive root is `φ`.  
* Formalise the cost-recurrence lemma `cₙ₊₁ = cₙ + cₙ₋₁` within `Foundations.CostFunctional`.  
* Combine to prove `limit (cₙ₊₁ / cₙ) = φ`, constituting `Foundation8_GoldenRatio`. (Cross-reference: Builds on Foundations 2, 3, and 7.)  
* *Challenge:* The limit proof may need convergence lemmas; if avoiding Mathlib, implement a basic epsilon-delta framework.

### 9. Logical Chain Master Theorem

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Start with the meta-principle; derive sequentially Foundations 1-8 using the arguments above.  
2.  By composition of implications, obtain a single theorem: `MetaPrinciple → (∧_{i=1}^8 Foundationᵢ)`, ensuring the entire framework is a necessary consequence of the meta-principle.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* Create a new file `Foundations.MasterTheorem.lean`.  
* Import each foundation module, state `theorem meta_chain : MetaPrinciple → (Foundation1 ∧ … ∧ Foundation8)`.  
* Provide 8 sub-proofs, each calling the corresponding derivation theorem proved earlier.  
* Finish with `exact And.intro …` building the conjunction.  
* *Challenge:* Managing dependencies across 8 imports may require careful namespace handling to avoid clashes.

### 10. Cost / Scale Optimisation Links (φ as Ledger Optimum)

**Conceptual argument**  
1.  Let `V : ℝ⁺ → ℝ` be the net value function `V(x) = Benefit(x) – Cost(x)` over one recognition cycle.  
2.  Using the recurrence from item 8, show `V` is maximised when successive cost ratios equal φ.  
3.  Any deviation from φ decreases long-term net value, establishing φ as an *evolutionarily stable* constant and maintaining ledger balance per the meta-principle.

**Lean-level sketch**  
* In `Foundations.CostFunctional`, define `V x = x – 1 – 1/x`.  
* Compute `dV/dx` and show its unique positive zero is φ.  
* Prove `d²V/dx² < 0` at φ, confirming a maximum.  
* Provide a theorem `optimal_cost_ratio : argmax V = φ`.  
* Correlate this with the ledger balance to close the optimisation loop. (Cross-reference: Ties together Foundations 2, 3, and 8.)  
* *Challenge:* Continuous optimisation in Lean requires defining derivatives constructively, possibly via limits.

The derivation roadmap is now complete for items 1–10.  Remaining future work includes turning each sketch into formal Lean proofs and updating documentation once proofs are in place.
