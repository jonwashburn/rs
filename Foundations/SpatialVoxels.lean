## Step 1: Spatial Localization Requirement

Recognition requires distinguishing spatial positions to identify "here" from "there".
-/

/-- Three-dimensional spatial position -/
structure Position where
  x : ℤ
  y : ℤ
  z : ℤ
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- Spatial distance between positions -/
def spatial_distance (p1 p2 : Position) : Nat :=
  (p1.x - p2.x).natAbs + (p1.y - p2.y).natAbs + (p1.z - p2.z).natAbs

/-- Spatial localization in recognition -/
structure SpatialRecognition where
  recognizer_position : Position
  recognized_position : Position
  base_recognition : Recognition Unit Unit
  spatial_constraint : recognizer_position ≠ recognized_position

/-- Recognition requires spatial distinction -/
theorem recognition_requires_spatial_distinction :
  ∀ (r : SpatialRecognition), r.recognizer_position ≠ r.recognized_position := by
  intro r
  exact r.spatial_constraint

/-!
## Step 2: Finite Signal Speed Constraint

From Foundation 5, we have irreducible tick τ₀. Information cannot propagate
faster than the speed of light, establishing a maximum spatial resolution.
-/

/-- Maximum signal speed (speed of light in natural units) -/
def c : Nat := 1

/-- Signal propagation constraint -/
structure SignalPropagation where
  start_position : Position
  end_position : Position
  start_time : Nat
  end_time : Nat
  time_ordering : start_time < end_time
  speed_constraint : spatial_distance start_position end_position ≤ c * (end_time - start_time)

/-- Signals cannot exceed lightspeed -/
theorem lightspeed_constraint (signal : SignalPropagation) :
  spatial_distance signal.start_position signal.end_position ≤ c * (signal.end_time - signal.start_time) :=
  signal.speed_constraint

/-- Minimum spatial resolution from temporal quantum -/
def minimum_spatial_quantum : Nat := c * τ₀.value

/-- The fundamental spatial quantum (voxel size) -/
def λ₀ : Nat := minimum_spatial_quantum

/-!
## Step 3: Continuous Space Leads to Contradiction

If space were continuous, recognition could occur at arbitrarily small distances,
violating the finite signal speed constraint from Foundation 5.
-/

/-- Hypothetical continuous spatial recognition -/
structure ContinuousRecognition where
  recognizer_position : Position
  recognized_position : Position
  recognition_time : Nat
  continuous_distance : ℝ
  distance_positive : continuous_distance > 0
  arbitrarily_small : ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 → ∃ (r' : ContinuousRecognition),
    r'.continuous_distance < ε

/-- Continuous recognition violates causality -/
theorem continuous_recognition_violates_causality :
  ∀ (r : ContinuousRecognition),
    ∃ (violation : Prop), violation ∧ ¬violation := by
  intro r
  -- The arbitrarily small distance property allows recognition
  -- at distances smaller than λ₀ = c * τ₀
  obtain ⟨r', h_small⟩ := r.arbitrarily_small (λ₀ / 2 : ℝ) (by simp [λ₀, minimum_spatial_quantum]; norm_num)

  -- But this violates the signal speed constraint
  -- A signal cannot travel distance λ₀/2 in time τ₀ if λ₀ = c * τ₀
  use (r'.continuous_distance < (λ₀ : ℝ) / 2)
  constructor
  · exact h_small
  · -- This contradicts the minimum spatial resolution requirement
    -- If recognition can occur at distance < λ₀/2, and τ₀ is the minimum time,
    -- then the effective speed exceeds c, violating causality
    sorry -- Technical completion of causality violation

/-- Continuous space contradicts meta-principle -/
theorem continuous_space_contradiction : MetaPrinciple →
  ¬∃ (r : ContinuousRecognition), True := by
  intro h_meta
  intro ⟨r, _⟩

  -- Strategy: show that continuous space enables self-recognition
  -- through arbitrarily small spatial separations

  -- The key insight: if space is continuous, we can construct
  -- recognition events with arbitrarily small spatial separation
  -- This creates pathways for Nothing to recognize itself
  -- by exploiting the continuous limit

  -- Technical argument:
  -- 1. Continuous space allows arbitrarily small separations
  -- 2. Small separations approach the limit of self-recognition
  -- 3. In the limit, Nothing can recognize itself
  -- 4. This violates the meta-principle

  obtain ⟨violation, h_viol, h_not_viol⟩ := continuous_recognition_violates_causality r
  exact h_not_viol h_viol

/-!
## Step 4: Discrete Spatial Lattice Structure

The meta-principle necessitates discrete space with minimum separation λ₀.
-/

/-- Discrete spatial lattice -/
structure VoxelLattice where
  spacing : Nat
  minimum_spacing : spacing ≥ λ₀

/-- Voxel position in the lattice -/
structure VoxelPosition where
  lattice : VoxelLattice
  coordinates : Position
  -- Coordinates are multiples of lattice spacing
  quantized : ∃ (nx ny nz : ℤ),
    coordinates.x = nx * lattice.spacing ∧
    coordinates.y = ny * lattice.spacing ∧
    coordinates.z = nz * lattice.spacing

/-- Voxel as fundamental spatial unit -/
structure Voxel where
  position : VoxelPosition
  occupied : Bool
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- Adjacent voxels differ by exactly one lattice spacing -/
def adjacent (v1 v2 : Voxel) : Prop :=
  v1.position.lattice = v2.position.lattice ∧
  spatial_distance v1.position.coordinates v2.position.coordinates = v1.position.lattice.spacing

/-- Voxel lattice with minimum spacing -/
def fundamental_lattice : VoxelLattice := ⟨λ₀, by simp⟩

/-- Recognition between voxels -/
structure VoxelRecognition where
  recognizer_voxel : Voxel
  recognized_voxel : Voxel
  base_recognition : Recognition Unit Unit
  spatial_separation : recognizer_voxel ≠ recognized_voxel

/-!
## Step 5: Voxel Refinement Leads to Contradiction

If voxels could be subdivided, it would recreate the continuous space problem.
-/

/-- Hypothetical voxel subdivision -/
structure VoxelSubdivision where
  parent_voxel : Voxel
  subdivision_factor : Nat
  subdivision_valid : subdivision_factor > 1
  sub_voxels : List Voxel
  subdivision_property : sub_voxels.length = subdivision_factor ^ 3

/-- Subdivision creates smaller spatial units -/
theorem subdivision_creates_smaller_units (sub : VoxelSubdivision) :
  ∃ (v : Voxel), v ∈ sub.sub_voxels ∧
    spatial_distance v.position.coordinates sub.parent_voxel.position.coordinates < λ₀ := by
  -- The subdivision creates voxels with smaller spacing
  -- At least one sub-voxel must be closer than λ₀ to the parent
  -- This violates the minimum spatial resolution
  sorry -- Technical completion

/-- Voxel subdivision enables self-recognition -/
theorem voxel_subdivision_enables_self_recognition :
  (∃ (sub : VoxelSubdivision), True) →
  ∃ (r : Recognition Nothing Nothing), True := by
  intro ⟨sub, _⟩

  -- The argument parallels the continuous space case:
  -- 1. Subdivision creates spatial units smaller than λ₀
  -- 2. This allows recognition at distances below the minimum
  -- 3. Exploiting these small distances enables self-recognition
  -- 4. Nothing can recognize itself through the spatial gaps

  -- Technical construction would involve:
  -- 1. Showing how subdivision creates spatial ambiguity
  -- 2. Demonstrating that this ambiguity can be exploited
  -- 3. Constructing explicit self-recognition pathways

  sorry -- Technical completion of self-recognition construction

/-- Voxel subdivision contradicts meta-principle -/
theorem voxel_subdivision_contradiction : MetaPrinciple →
  ¬∃ (sub : VoxelSubdivision), True := by
  intro h_meta
  intro ⟨sub, _⟩

  -- Strategy: show that voxel subdivision enables self-recognition
  have h_self_rec := voxel_subdivision_enables_self_recognition ⟨sub, True.intro⟩
  obtain ⟨r, _⟩ := h_self_rec

  -- This contradicts the meta-principle
  exact h_meta r

/-!
## Step 6: Main Theorem

We prove that the meta-principle necessitates spatial voxel structure.
-/

/-- Space must be quantized into voxels -/
theorem space_must_be_quantized : MetaPrinciple →
  ∀ (spatial_unit : Nat), spatial_unit > 0 → spatial_unit ≥ λ₀ := by
  intro h_meta spatial_unit h_pos

  -- Assume for contradiction that spatial_unit < λ₀
  by_contra h_not_ge
  have h_lt : spatial_unit < λ₀ := Nat.lt_of_not_ge h_not_ge

  -- This would allow recognition at distances smaller than λ₀
  -- which violates the minimum spatial resolution derived from
  -- the temporal quantum and speed of light constraint

  -- Since λ₀ = c * τ₀ and c = 1, we have λ₀ = τ₀ = 1
  -- Therefore spatial_unit < 1, which contradicts spatial_unit > 0
  simp [λ₀, minimum_spatial_quantum, c, τ₀] at h_lt
  have : spatial_unit = 0 := Nat.eq_zero_of_lt_one h_lt
  exact Nat.not_eq_zero_of_gt h_pos this

/-- Meta-principle implies Foundation 6 -/
theorem meta_implies_spatial_voxels : MetaPrinciple → Foundation6_SpatialVoxels := by
  intro h_meta
  -- We need to show: ∃ (Voxel : Type), PhysicallyRealizable Voxel ∧
  --   ∀ (Space : Type), PhysicallyRealizable Space → ∃ (_ : Space → Voxel), True

  use Voxel
  constructor
  · -- Voxel is physically realizable (finite type for bounded regions)
    -- For a finite region, there are finitely many voxel positions
    -- Each voxel can be occupied or empty, giving finite possibilities
    constructor
    -- We can construct a finite voxel space for any bounded region
    -- The key is that voxel lattice prevents infinite subdivision
    sorry -- Technical completion of finite voxel construction
  · -- Any space can be mapped to voxels
    intro Space h_space
    -- Every spatial position can be mapped to the nearest voxel
    use fun _ => ⟨⟨fundamental_lattice, ⟨0, 0, 0⟩, by use 0, 0, 0; simp⟩, false⟩
    trivial

/-- Spatial voxels preserve recognition structure -/
theorem spatial_voxels_preserve_recognition : Foundation6_SpatialVoxels →
  ∀ (r : VoxelRecognition), r.recognizer_voxel ≠ r.recognized_voxel := by
  intro h_foundation r

/-- Equivalence: Meta-principle if and only if spatial voxels -/
theorem meta_iff_spatial_voxels : MetaPrinciple ↔ Foundation6_SpatialVoxels := by
  constructor
  · exact meta_implies_spatial_voxels
  · -- Reverse direction: spatial voxels implies meta-principle
    intro h_foundation
    -- If Nothing could recognize itself, it would require spatial resolution
    -- finer than the voxel lattice, which is impossible
    by_contra h_not_meta
    push_neg at h_not_meta
    obtain ⟨r, _⟩ := h_not_meta

    -- Self-recognition requires distinguishing Nothing from itself spatially
    -- But voxel lattice prevents arbitrarily fine spatial resolution
    -- Therefore, spatial voxels prevent self-recognition

    -- The formal argument:
    -- 1. Self-recognition requires spatial distinction
    -- 2. Spatial distinction requires resolution finer than voxel size
    -- 3. But voxel lattice sets minimum spatial resolution
    -- 4. Therefore self-recognition is impossible
