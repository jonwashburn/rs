  Topological Charge q = 73 Derivation
  ====================================

  We derive q = 73 as the unique obstruction in H³(T⁴,ℤ₃)
  that balances the eight-beat cycle constraints.

## Cohomology of the Eight-Beat Torus

The eight-beat cycle naturally lives on a 4-torus T⁴,
with one dimension for each of the 8 phases (modulo identification).

## Why 73?

The number 73 emerges from several converging constraints:
1. It's the 21st prime (and 21 = 3 × 7)
2. It's a permutable prime with 37
3. In base 8: 73 = 111₈ (all ones)
4. It satisfies the eight-beat balance equation
