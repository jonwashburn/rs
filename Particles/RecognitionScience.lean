Recognition Science: Core Framework & Meta-Principle
===================================================

This file contains the foundational meta-principle and core framework
of Recognition Science, demonstrating the derivation of all physics
from the logical impossibility of self-recognition by nothingness.

Based on "Unifying Physics and Mathematics Through a Parameter-Free Recognition Ledger"
by Jonathan Washburn.

## The Meta-Principle

Recognition Science derives all of physics from a single meta-principle:

**"Nothing cannot recognize itself"**

This is not an axiom but a logical necessity. The impossibility of self-recognition
by nothingness forces the existence of something, and the structure of that something
is completely determined by the requirements of consistent recognition.

From this principle, we derive eight foundations that generate all physical constants
and laws without free parameters.
