  the requirement to minimize recognition cost while allowing growth.

## The Cost Functional

Recognition requires partitioning resources between self and other.
The cost of maintaining this partition is given by J(x).

## The Golden Ratio Emerges from Scaling

The minimum at x = 1 gives J(1) = 1, representing perfect balance
but no growth. For recognition to propagate through scales,
we need the minimum cost that allows scaling: J(λ) = λ.

## Summary

The golden ratio φ emerges as the unique scaling factor > 1
that satisfies J(φ) = φ. This represents the perfect balance
between self-recognition and growth.

Key results:
1. J(x) = (x + 1/x)/2 from recognition symmetry
2. Minimum at x = 1 (perfect balance, no growth)
3. Scaling requirement J(λ) = λ forces λ = φ
4. φ is unique: no other value allows stable scaling
